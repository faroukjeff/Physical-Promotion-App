## Git Notes

* Pull the git origin from the repo to your computer
* Run the "npm install" command so that the modules are installed and the node_modules folder is generated
* Test if the app is running by using the command "node app.js"
* If you install any new package make sure to resolve the conflicts carefully in the package.json when you push to git or merge branches
