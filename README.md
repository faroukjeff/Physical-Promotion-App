# Physical Activity Promotion App


Physical activity promotion is an app that is designed and targeted for people that need to improve their physical activity during the day. Users will be able to choose different plans for their physical activity depending on their work schedule or study or anything to their liking and they will also get recommendations from the app based on the amount of activity they have. The app will be a web application with scalable web version for mobile phones and tablets. As we talk about design we have a three main parts, frontend, backend, and database. Frontend is represented by graphical interface or GUI which is available to all users to access through a web page and interact with the website and it’s the face of the app. Through that graphical interface they will get all the necessary information that they need from the app like a targeted activity for today, or a weekly plan and etc… which is based on their activity that’s recorded in the app. For front end development we are using React because it is a great framework for creating interactive User Interface (GUI).
